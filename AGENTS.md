# AGENTS.md instructions for C:\Users\garya\OneDrive\Documents\StoryLineOS\VMF-APP\dev-v1\VMF-v-1-client

## Skills
A skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.

### Available skills
- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. Use when users want to create or update a skill that extends Codex capabilities. (file: C:/Users/garya/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)
- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into `$CODEX_HOME/skills` from curated or GitHub sources. Use when users ask to list/install skills. (file: C:/Users/garya/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)
- frontend-design: Design and build production-grade React components/pages using the VMF design system, token architecture, and component library. (file: C:/Users/garya/OneDrive/Documents/StoryLineOS/VMF-APP/dev-v1/VMF-v-1-client/.git/skills/front-end-designer/SKILL.md)
- front-end-developer: Review and implement enterprise-quality frontend code with React/JS/CSS, Redux Toolkit, RTK Query, testing, and accessibility best practices. (file: C:/Users/garya/OneDrive/Documents/StoryLineOS/VMF-APP/dev-v1/VMF-v-1-client/.git/skills/front-end-developer/SKILL.md)
- frontend-api-integration: Build and maintain frontend API integration layers, auth/session handling, contract alignment, and API testing patterns. (file: C:/Users/garya/OneDrive/Documents/StoryLineOS/VMF-APP/dev-v1/VMF-v-1-client/.git/skills/frontend-api-integration/SKILL.md)
- pr-reviewer: Review pull request diffs with structured feedback on behavior, quality, security, tests, and maintainability. (file: C:/Users/garya/OneDrive/Documents/StoryLineOS/VMF-APP/dev-v1/VMF-v-1-client/.git/skills/pr-reviewer/SKILL.md)
- prd: Generate product requirements documents (PRDs), including discovery questions and structured requirement output. (file: C:/Users/garya/OneDrive/Documents/StoryLineOS/VMF-APP/dev-v1/VMF-v-1-client/.git/skills/prd-writer/SKILL.md)
- technical-writer: Convert PRDs into implementation-ready technical specifications with architecture, API, testing, rollout, and traceability. (file: C:/Users/garya/OneDrive/Documents/StoryLineOS/VMF-APP/dev-v1/VMF-v-1-client/.git/skills/technical-writer/SKILL.md)
- ui-ux-expert: Review UI/UX design and implementation quality against VMF token system, theming, component reuse, and accessibility standards. (file: C:/Users/garya/OneDrive/Documents/StoryLineOS/VMF-APP/dev-v1/VMF-v-1-client/.git/skills/ui-ux/SKILL.md)

### How to use skills
- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.
- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.
- Missing/blocked: If a named skill is not in the list or the path cannot be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.
- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):
  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.
  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (for example `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.
  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; do not bulk-load everything.
  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.
  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.
- Coordination and sequencing:
  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order used.
  - Announce which skill(s) are being used and why (one short line). If skipping an obvious skill, state why.
- Context hygiene:
  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.
  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless blocked.
  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only relevant reference files and note that choice.
- Safety and fallback: If a skill cannot be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, choose the next-best approach, and continue.
